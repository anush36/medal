    "A previous work provided a list of medical acronyms and their corresponding expansions, this formed the key-value pairs of targets. The authors then secured medical notes and identified sentences that contained expansions that are present in the targets dataset. These expansions were replaced in-place by the acronym that was present in the targets database. The data therefore contains the following fields:\n",

    "- location: the word index where the acronym was present\n",
    "- label: the correct expansion of the acronym\n",
    "- label_num: the index of the expansion in the label field. Since we are training a classification model, this index is what is actually outputted by the model, and is used to calculate the loss (generated by the load_dataframes function)"
